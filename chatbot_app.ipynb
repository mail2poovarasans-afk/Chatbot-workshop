        "# - The fallback_node correctly uses the 'error' message if available.\n",
        "# - The generate_response_node's handling of errors and no results is partially redundant because the graph transitions to 'fallback' in those cases. The 'generate_response' node will only be reached when results are successfully retrieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "# The existing logic seems robust for triggering the fallback on both explicit errors (which result in None results and an error message) and cases where no results are found (which also result in None results and a specific message). The 'generate_response' node will only be executed when results are available, so its internal fallback logic is not strictly necessary for the graph's flow, but the node itself is needed to format successful responses.\n",

        "# --- Performance Optimization Considerations ---\n",
        "# 1. Caching API Responses: For news or search results that are unlikely to change rapidly for the same query/category, caching could be beneficial. This would require implementing a caching layer (e.g., using `functools.lru_cache` or a dedicated caching library) within or around `get_news` and `perform_web_search`. This is an advanced optimization and depends on API terms of service and the expected query patterns. Not implementing caching directly in this step but noting it as a consideration.\n",
        "# 2. Asynchronous API Calls: If the underlying API libraries support asyncio, the `get_news` and `perform_web_search` functions could be made asynchronous and called concurrently within the LangGraph nodes or the Streamlit app for potentially faster response times, especially if multiple API calls were needed for a single query (not currently the case). This would require significant changes to the LangGraph state and node structure to handle async operations. Not implementing async directly in this step.\n",
        "# 3. Optimizing Prompt Engineering: If the LangGraph were to include LLM calls for query classification or response generation, prompt engineering would be crucial for performance (reducing token usage, faster processing) and cost. This is not applicable to the current graph which uses rule-based classification and direct API result formatting.\n",
        "# 4. Streamlit Frontend Performance:\n",
        "#    - Avoiding unnecessary re-renders: Streamlit reruns the entire script on every interaction. Using `st.session_state` correctly helps maintain state without re-computing everything. The current code uses session state correctly for messages.\n",
        "#    - Optimizing display: For large amounts of text, consider using `st.text_area` or `st.expander` to manage display. The current output format is simple strings, which should be fine.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Based on the review, the error handling is largely in place. The primary remaining task is to ensure the Streamlit frontend correctly wraps the actual LangGraph invocation in the try...except block. Performance optimizations like caching or async are noted as potential future enhancements but are not required by the current instructions.\n",

            "   - Verify that all necessary functions (classify_query, get_news, perform_web_search) are defined.\n",
            "   - Confirm that the LangGraph workflow (`app`) is correctly defined and compiled.\n",
            "   - Ensure the Streamlit frontend code is ready for deployment.\n",
            "   - Make sure your code reads API keys from environment variables (as implemented in a previous step).\n",

            "   - This file lists all Python libraries your application depends on (streamlit, langchain, langgraph, requests, etc.).\n",

            "     pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",

            "   - **Crucially, do not hardcode API keys in your code.**\n",
            "   - On the hosting platform's dashboard or configuration settings, set the environment variables (e.g., NEWS_API_KEY, WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY) with your actual API keys.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Step 5: Follow the specific deployment instructions for your chosen platform.\n",
            "   - **Streamlit Cloud:** Connect your GitHub repository, select the main file (e.g., chatbot_app.py), and add secrets (environment variables).\n",
            "   - **Heroku:** Use the Heroku CLI to create an app, link it to your Git repository, set config vars (environment variables), and push your code.\n",
            "   - **Render:** Connect your Git repository, choose a 'Web Service', configure the build command (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), and start command (`streamlit run your_app_file.py`), and add environment variables.\n",
            "   - **AWS/Google Cloud:** The steps vary significantly depending on the specific service used (e.g., creating a Docker image for ECS/Cloud Run, configuring an application on Elastic Beanstalk/App Engine).\n",
            "   - Generally, deployment involves connecting your code repository, setting up the build process (installing dependencies from requirements.txt), and defining the command to run your Streamlit app.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Step 6: Once deployed, test the live application.\n",
            "   - Access the public URL provided by your hosting platform.\n",
            "   - Interact with the chatbot using various queries (news, general, queries expected to fail) to ensure all functionalities work correctly.\n",

        "*   The necessary Python libraries, including `langchain`, `langgraph`, `streamlit`, and `requests`, were successfully installed.\n",
        "*   A method for secure API key management using environment variables was established, although loading from Colab secrets failed in the execution environment.\n",
        "*   A Python function `classify_query` was developed to categorize user input as \"news\" or \"general\" based on keywords and phrases.\n",
        "*   A `get_news` function was implemented to fetch news articles from a news API, handling categories and general queries, and including error handling for API key issues, request failures, JSON parsing, and no results found.\n",
        "*   A `perform_web_search` function was created to simulate interaction with a web search tool, also incorporating error handling for missing keys, request issues, JSON parsing, and no results.\n",
        "*   A LangGraph workflow was successfully designed with nodes for query classification, news fetching, web search, response generation, and a fallback mechanism. Conditional edges were configured to direct the flow based on the query type and the success/failure of API calls.\n",
        "*   Robust fallback mechanisms were confirmed to be in place within the LangGraph workflow, correctly transitioning to a fallback node upon API errors (indicated by error messages and `None` results) or when no relevant results are found.\n",
        "*   A Streamlit frontend structure was implemented, including session state for conversation history, message display, a chat input, and a sidebar for news category selection. The frontend structure includes a placeholder for invoking the LangGraph app and basic error handling for this invocation.\n",
        "*   Comprehensive testing instructions were provided, detailing how to run the Streamlit application and perform various tests covering different query types, API interactions, LangGraph flow, and fallback scenarios, along with expected outcomes.\n",
        "*   A step-by-step outline for deploying the Streamlit application on various hosting platforms was successfully generated.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   The Streamlit frontend code contains simulation logic for demonstration purposes. The next crucial step is to integrate the actual compiled LangGraph `app` object into the Streamlit `try...except` block to enable the full workflow.\n",
        "*   While basic error handling is in place, consider adding more specific exception handling in the Streamlit frontend or API functions if particular error types require different responses or logging. Future performance optimizations like API response caching or asynchronous calls can be explored if needed.\n"
